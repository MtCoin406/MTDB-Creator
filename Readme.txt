MTDB Creator

== Overview ==

The MTDBCreator will read a series of Peptide Hit Result Processor (PHRP) output files
from X!Tandem or Sequest search results, align the data, then create a standalone
SQLite database compatible with MultiAlign.  For an example please see the 
exampleDatabase.db3 file installed with the program (typically at 
C:\Program Files (x86)\MTDBCreator\)  For more information on PHRP, see 
http://omics.pnl.gov/software/PeptideHitResultsProcessor.php

== Details ==

Run the program, then click "Start Analysis".  Next click the appropriate
button to select the PSM search results to process.  For X!Tandem, you choose
the _xt.txt files (created by PHRP).  For SEQUEST choose the _syn.txt files.

Next, click "OK" and you will see a list of your datasets.  

== Example Data ==

Example data files are available at http://omics.pnl.gov/software/MTDBCreator.php
