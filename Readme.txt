MTDB Creator

== Overview ==

The MTDBCreator will read a series of Peptide Hit Result Processor (PHRP) output files
from X!Tandem or Sequest search results, align the data, then create a standalone
Microsoft Access DB.  For an example please see the ExampleDatabase.mdb file
installed with the program (typically at C:\Program Files\MTDBCreator\)  For
more information on PHRP, see http://omics.pnl.gov/software/PeptideHitResultsProcessor.php

== Details ==
Use File->Load to select a file defining the paths to the folders
containing the input PHRP files to use to create the mass tag database.  As an 
example, see file DatasetDescription.txt.  You will need to customize this file
as needed to read your own data files.  Use Tools->Options to define the filters
for aligning the data and for storing the data in the database.  Next, use
Tools->Create Mass Tag Database to align the data files and create the Microsoft
Access database.  Following this, the alignment of individual datasets can be 
visualized by clicking on the dataset name in the list at the bottom of the program

Note that version 2.x of MTDB Creator requires Office 2007.
Also, if you find that the T_Proteins table has a lot of blank lines, please
manually delete them before using the file with MultiAlign.

== Example Data ==

Unzip these .Zip files to obtain these files:

1. Example input files for MTDB Creator
	- In MTDB_Creator_Example_Data.zip
	- File QC_Shew_Datasets.txt 
		- Select this file in MTDB Creator using File->Load
		- This file lists the dataset names and paths to the SEQUEST result folders
		- You will need to customize the paths in this file to match the paths on your computer
	- Folder Sequest_Data in this .Zip file contains the Peptide Hit Results Processor files 
	  processed by the MTDB Creator

2. Accurate Mass and Time Tag Database (AMT tag DB) created by MTDB Creator
	- In MTDB_Creator_Example_Data.zip
	- File QC_Shew_10_Cougar.mdb
		- This file was built by the MTDBCreator application using the SEQUEST 
		  search results for 8 QC_Shew datasets from a Thermo Fisher Scientific 
		  LTQ-Orbitrap instrument. 
		- The SEQUEST result files are in folder Sequest_Data
	- For backwards compatibility, we have also included 
	  file QC_Shew_10_Cougar_Access2003.mdb, which is in the Office 2003 file format

3. Features files generated by Decon2LS
	- In MultiAlign_Example_Data.zip in folder Cluster_Two_Datasets
	- Files: QC_Shew_10_02b_2Nov10_Cougar_10-09-08_isos
	         QC_Shew_10_02g_2Nov10_Cougar_10-09-09_isos
	- These datasets were generated from the analysis of a Shewanella Oneidensis MR-1
      sample on a Thermo Fisher Scientific LTQ-Orbitrap instrument.

4. An example Multialign output file
	- In MultiAlign_Example_Data.zip in folder Cluster_Two_Datasets\QC_Shew_10_02b_2Nov10_Cougar\
	- File: QC_Shew_10_02b_2Nov10_Cougar.mln 
	- Load this file into MultiAlign using File->Open Analysis File

5. An example VIPER output file
	- In VIPER_Example_Data.zip
	- File: QC_Shew_10_02b_2Nov10_Cougar_10-09-08_isos.gel
	- This file contains data from the QC_Shew_10_02b_2Nov10_Cougar_10-09-08_isos.csv file
	  aligned and matched against the AMT tags in QC_Shew_10_Cougar_Access2003.mdb
