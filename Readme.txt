MTDB Creator

== Overview ==

The MTDBCreator will read a series of Peptide Hit Result Processor (PHRP) output files
from X!Tandem or Sequest search results, align the data, then create a standalone
SQLite database compatible with MultiAlign.  For an example please see the 
Example_Database.db3 file installed with the program (typically at 
C:\Program Files (x86)\MTDBCreator\)  For more information on PHRP, see 
http://omics.pnl.gov/software/PeptideHitResultsProcessor.php

== Details ==

Run the program, then click "Start Analysis".  Next click the appropriate
button to select the PSM search results to load.  For X!Tandem, you choose
the _xt.txt files (created by PHRP).  For SEQUEST choose the _syn.txt files.

Next, click "OK" and you will see a list of your datasets.  At this point you can
double click each dataset in the list and the data for that dataset will be 
loaded and regressed against the Predicted NET scale.  However, there is no need
to manually click each dataset.  Instead, just click "Create Database" and 
the program will process all of your datasets to create an in-memory database.
Once processing is complete, click "Save Database" to save a new SqLite file
to disk.
