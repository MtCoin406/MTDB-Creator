The MTDBCreator will read a series of Peptide Hit Result Processor output files
from X!Tandem search results, align the data, then create a standalone
Microsoft Access DB. For an example please see data in the data folder. 
The file DatasetDescription.txt is loaded into MTDBCreator and provides it with 
information about the input PHRP files used to create the mass tag database. 
The Tools menu provides the ability to create the Mass Tag Database. Individual 
datasets can be visualized by clicking on the bottom list. Users need to modify
this file or create a similar file, with appropriate path names for the input 
data for the program to work correctly.

Note: this is a beta release of this software.  Please visit
